As there is a trend on creating Web Services based on REST as it is easier to build and consume than using SOAP-services.

When using REST, HTTP is used for calls between machines. REST uses HTTP for  CRUD operations, where CRUD stands for create/read/update/delete.

With projects which include REST-based Web services we needed the possibility to send a request with an xml payload, most of the existing testing tools do not support this, that is why we have created a rest sampler plug-in where you can define the following:

  * Method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
  * Base url
  * Port
  * Resource
  * Headers: if there are any headers which should be part of the request
  * Body: xml payload to be sent
